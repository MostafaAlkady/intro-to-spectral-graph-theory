A practical introduction to Spectral Graph Theory that goes over its applications in the following topics:
- Laplacian Matrix and its spectrum
- Community Structure and Fiedler Vector
- Bounding Convergence Rate in Random Walks
- Sparse Cuts and Cheeger's Inequality
- Non-backtracking Matrix

The notebook will be expanded in the future to have more topics and applications.
